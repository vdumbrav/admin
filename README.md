# Shadcn Admin Dashboard

Admin Dashboard UI crafted with Shadcn and Vite. Built with responsiveness and accessibility in mind.

![alt text](public/images/shadcn-admin.png)

I've been creating dashboard UIs at work and for my personal projects. I always wanted to make a reusable collection of dashboard UI for future projects; and here it is now. While I've created a few custom components, some of the code is directly adapted from ShadcnUI examples.

> This is not a starter project (template) though. I'll probably make one in the future.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/satnaing/shadcn-admin.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd shadcn-admin
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pnpm install
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust as needed:

```env
VITE_USE_FAKE_API=true
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

VITE_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173
VITE_OIDC_AUTHORITY=https://keycloak.example.com/realms/your-realm
VITE_USE_FAKE_AUTH=true
```

Set `VITE_USE_FAKE_AUTH` and `VITE_USE_FAKE_API` to `false` to use real Keycloak and API endpoints. The access token for real mode is stored in `localStorage` under the key `oidc.user:<authority>:mobile_app`.

Start the server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
