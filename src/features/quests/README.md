# Quests Module

## Project Scope
- Only Quests and Settings are shipped in this admin.
- Authentication uses OIDC; all authenticated routes require sign-in.

## Notes
- Drag-and-drop reordering works on the full list and disables filters while active.
- Multiple quests can be edited in one session.
- Filters are cleared when reordering to prevent inconsistent order.
